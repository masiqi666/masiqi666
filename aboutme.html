                    <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
                    My name is Siqi Ma, I was born in 1998 in China’s Inner Mongolia Hohhot. I 21 years lived in Inner
                    Mongolia, I don’t know whether you realize it in Inner Mongolia, Inner Mongolia is actually a lot of
                    ethnic minority areas. Such as me, I am an ethnic minority, and I am a Mongolian people. Although I
                    since the childhood are teaching Chinese, but occasionally say a few words of Mongolian. I since the
                    childhood to more interested in art, like painting, photography, and dancing. In junior high school,
                    because to see cats, so I like musicals, after I’ve been looking forward to the development, but the
                    reality is skinny, often I’ve been focusing on math teaching, Chinese, maths, English, history,
                    geography, etc. These courses, my parents wouldn’t let me interested to contact me, but I understand
                    them. I found that after finishing high school, I can’t concentrate on what they don’t like, so I
                    choose to read a professional, I like Australia even said that now my English is not very good,
                    sometimes don’t understand the teacher’s curriculum, students say, it is difficult to smooth
                    communication, but because I like, so I won’t retreat, I can only think of later I will be engaged
                    in the work. I like I will be full of confidence, when it comes to my creativity. To be honest, I’ve
                    always thought is very creative in when I was a kid, I always draw some I think good, though not a
                    professional, but I have never been rules were trapped. AndI like to go on his own this draw some
                    belongs to own thing, often to match different dress style. but with the growing up, I became more
                    and more without thinking, and sometimes even want to draw something, say a thought it is difficult
                    to do, so now I try to break his own inherent thinking. Allow yourself to make your dreams come true
                    again through creativity.
