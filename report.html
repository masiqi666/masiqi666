                    <h3>Journal on Flowers of War and Orientalism </h3>
                    <p>The film I chose is called Flowers of War, which takes the nanjing Massacre as the background of
                        The Times.The film tells the story of the Japanese occupation of Nanjing. A large number of
                        refugees on the streets were killed by the Japanese army, but a foreign church has become a
                        refuge for these refugees, there are 13 prostitutes and a dozen female students and several
                        wounded soldiers in the foreign church. This also shows the superiority of Orientalism.
                        Westerners become the saviour of the Chinese at a critical moment, and also express the idea
                        that only the West can save the East.
                    </p>
                    <p>Said(1978) pointed out that orientalism was dominated by the reorganization of the West and had
                        authority over the East (p.3). As reflected in the film, the female student is embarrassed by
                        the arrival of her first period, believing that women are dirty and sinful and that she is of
                        the same kind as the prostitutes in the church. This also shows that the West imposes morality
                        and ideology on the East through the spread of religion, and that the East has no power to
                        change this state".The relationship between East and West is one of domination or power. Complex
                        hegemony of varying degrees "(said,1978, p.5). In the film, even though the prostitute is ready
                        to go out of the church to save the girl, the church bell rings and the schoolgirl chooses to go
                        downstairs to listen to the bell even at the risk of her life. And because of the baptism of the
                        bells thirteen prostitutes also boldly out of the church to save his compatriots, which reflects
                        a kind of religious hegemony.</p>
                    <p>In the film, a priest turns down a prostitute who asks for his help. Although he is a Western
                        priest in the East, from the side, we can see that his Orientalism expresses the deep contempt
                        of The Europeans for the Oriental people. This is precisely what Said(1978) claimed that
                        "Orientalism has never been far from what Danys Hay called the European ideal, that is, the
                        collective concept of distinguishing between" we "Europeans and all" non-Europeans " (p.7).
                        Through this film, it is obvious that the West imposes the western cultural concepts and
                        ideologies on the East through preaching, and it also reflects the fact that the eastern culture
                        is dominated by the Western culture. Although the concepts of the East and the West belong to
                        the binary opposition, they are actually unequal, Instead, the West dominates the East.

                    <h3>The Media Industry and Globalization</h3>
                    <p>The media has become a world event and a link between people. Oversupply has become an obvious
                        phenomenon in the entertainment industry, where buyers dominate. People around the world have
                        also been described as sovereign consumers in neoliberal theory(Mirrlees, p. 209). However, in
                        the media market, people's demands for TV programs, movies and variety shows can be reflected
                        through the market (210), which also reflects the demands of consumers and producers, which are
                        relatively important in the media industry(Mirrlees, p. 210). Tucker argues that the main aspect
                        of market coordination in capitalism is the interaction between consumers and producers (p.
                        443). For example, in this documentary, the new force of economy and politics is the media
                        industry, which enables consumers and producers to bring benefits to the economy. The
                        documentary describes how information and products transmitted from the media to the public have
                        become a commodity that can be traded through money. Monroe describes the production of media
                        entertainment as a public good for neoliberalism(p. 211). Under the neoliberal model, the
                        audience has been regarded as consumers in the market, while entertainment products are regarded
                        as commodities that can be traded with money (Mirrlees, p. 212). Entertainment products are no
                        longer based on self-thinking and social problems, but to enhance the happiness of the audience,
                        that is, consumers. In order to achieve certain economic benefits. To analyze this documentary
                        from the perspective of capitalism is to carry out media globalization, namely transnational
                        capitalism, by sticking to the idea of capitalism. Profits are made by producing entertainment
                        products and consumers' consumption. However, if consumers are not satisfied with the products,
                        they may not reach the standard of income(Mirrlees, p. 210). From the perspective of new
                        liberalism, consumers are encouraged to choose products freely and have the right to choose and
                        love products freely. But it also reduces the power and power of the media(Mirrlees, p.212).
                        Clearly, this is for the purpose of strengthening capital flows. In addition, it is clearly
                        mentioned in the documentary that in the global system, the information obtained from the media
                        flows unevenly and the hierarchical distribution is unfair. Socio-economic levels in countries
                        are the main factor affecting the uneven distribution of entertainment information through
                        Mirrlees (212). It also suggests that corruption in the entertainment industry is linked to
                        economics and politics.</p>
